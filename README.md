# Create ML Benchmark

I wanted to benchmark Apple's M1 Macbook Air to the new 2021 M1 Max Macbook Pro. This Create ML benchmark uses a simple project to measure the training time with different dataset and batch size settings.

## Roboflow Project

The dataset is up on Roboflow.com. You can download the datasets with these links
