# Pascal Voc Dataset Results for M1 Macbook Air

I ran the tests a few times and they are generally consistent. The results in the table aren't averages. Once I run them a few more times, I will update it with averages.

## Hardware Specs
* M1
* 8 GPU
* 8 CPU
* 16G unified memory
* Monterey
* CreateML 3

## Pascal Dataset

* training 13,299 
* validation 3,302 
* classes 20
* zipped file 

## Table of results

Screen shots of each run is in the folders.

* elapsed time is in minutes from the reported start and finish
* training accuracy is the final average accuracy across all classes
* validation accuracy is the final average accuracy across all classes
* top class Intersetion/Union reported from the training dataset
* top class Intersetion/Union reported from the validation dataset

## Observations

During the training, the GPU was above 90% utilization. CPU usage was around 50%. Performance was similar to COCO Dataset.
